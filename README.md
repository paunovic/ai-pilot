Executing parallel competitor analysis task...

You are extremely correct and diligent expert task planner.
Decompose the complex task into well-defined subtasks.
Don't go overboard though - keep subtasks focused and manageable.

Task: Research pricing for competitors A, B, C simultaneously
Data: ```{
  "competitors": [
    "CompetitorA",
    "CompetitorB",
    "CompetitorC"
  ],
  "prices": {
    "CompetitorA": "3.44, 4.99, 5.99",
    "CompetitorB": "2.99, 4.49, 6.49",
    "CompetitorC": "3.29, 5.29, 6.99"
  }
}```

Rules that you MUST follow no matter what:
- Keep subtasks focused and atomic
- Each subtask should have a clear, measurable objective
- ALL relevant data MUST BE included in the subtask data field
- DO NOT assume subtask have access to data outside of what you provide

IMPORTANT: Your response is parsed with `llm.with_structured_output()` so you MUST respond ONLY with a structured response that is compatible with Pydantic.

You MUST respond ONLY with a structured JSON response with your analysis results.
Do NOT include any comments, newlines or trailing commas in the response JSON.
Do NOT include any explanations outside the JSON, your response will be parsed programmatically with Python `json.loads()`.
JSON response must be valid and parsable with Python `json.loads()`
JSON response must not contain comments, newlines or trailing commas.
JSON response must not be pretty formatted.

JSON MUST include a "confidence" field (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how confident you are in your analysis results.
Consider factors like:
- Completeness of available data
- Clarity of the task
- Quality of your findings/analysis
- Any uncertainties or assumptions made

If applicable, also include a "confidence_reasoning" field explaining your confidence level.

Analyze relevant information and return as JSON strictly following the following format:
{"patterns": [...],"insights": [...],"recommendations": [...],"confidence": 0.0-1.0,"confidence_reasoning": "explanation of confidence level"}

`...` indicates items and should be filled accordingly.
